QRToad: Is a ColdFusion Interface for the itext library
http://itextpdf.com/download.php

To install:

1. Download the java code and docs from http://itextpdf.com/download.php
2. Copy the itext jar (an optionally the itext extras jar) file to your ColdFusion server Class path. I put mine in Coldfusion9/lib/.
3. Restart the ColdFusion Service.


To use:
At it's simplest you only need to create the component and pass one parameter to it.

<cfset qr = createObject("component","com.timcunningham.QRToad.QRCode")>
<cfcontent reset="true" variable="#qr.getQRCode("http://cfmumbojumbo.com")#" type="image/png">

This will create a QR code that is black and white 150 x 150 pixels that takes you to cfmumbojumbo.com



Also see the getQRtest.html example that shows how you can use this code in relation to an HTML img src=

Thanks,

Tim Cunningham

which I greatfully "borrowed." Remember kids, if you steal from TimmyC, you stole twice!
