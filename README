QRToad: Is a ColdFusion Interface for the itext library
http://itextpdf.com/download.php

To install:

1. 	Download the latest release .zip from https://github.com/itext/itextpdf/releases 
2. 	Copy the itext jar (itext5-itextpdf-5.5.12.jar) (and optionally the itext extras jar) 
        file to your ColdFusion server class path. I put mine in Coldfusion9/lib/. On Lucee
	consider using an Application.cfc specific directory via this.javaSettings
3. 	Restart the ColdFusion Service. On Lucee this is not required if this.javaSettings contains
        'reloadOnChange'

To use:
At it's simplest you only need to create the component and pass one parameter to it.

	<cfset qr = createObject("component","com.timcunningham.QRToad.QRCode")>
	<cfcontent reset="true" variable="#qr.getQRCode("http://cfmumbojumbo.com")#" 
	type="image/png">

This will create a QR code that is black and white 150 x 150 pixels that takes you to 
cfmumbojumbo.com

Also see the getQRtest.html example that shows how you can use this code in relation
to an HTML img src=

Thanks,

gave me the idea to use iText and some working sample code, which I greatfully 
"borrowed." Remember kids, if you steal from TimmyC, you stole twice!
